## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 4 phases at coarse granularity -- Foundation, Admin UI, Publish Pipeline, Full Dashboard Types
- [Roadmap]: Engine fixes (ENGN-*) bundled into Phase 1 to harden the pipeline before wizard integration
- [Roadmap]: STAT-01 (drafts start as draft) assigned to Phase 2 with wizard; STAT-02/03/04 assigned to Phase 3 with publish
- [01-01]: Used @supabase/ssr three-client pattern (browser/server/middleware) per research
- [01-01]: getClaims() for JWT validation instead of getSession() (security)
- [01-01]: Account provisioning via Supabase dashboard (no sign-up flow in app)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 1]: Supabase SSR + Cloudflare Workers compatibility is highest-risk integration -- needs wrangler dev validation early
- [Phase 1]: Next.js 14 vs 15 decision must be made before building on the platform
